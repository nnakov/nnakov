1. When you write a program, which repeats output texts (customer, number, sum) do the following:
- Take input
- Do the neccesary operations with variables. DON'T show otput at every variable change
- Show output

Example:
INPUT
printf("Input the unit consumed by the customer : ");
   scanf("%d",&conu);

VARIABLE OPERATIONS
   if (conu <200 )
	chg = 1.20;
  else	if (conu>=200 && conu<400)
		chg = 1.50;
    
OUTPUT
  printf("\nElectricity Bill\n");
   printf("Customer IDNO                       :%d\n",custid);
   printf("Customer Name                       :%s\n",connm);
   printf("unit Consumed                       :%d\n",conu);

2. When you have multiple case1,case2 with same output:
   then just write them together and write only 1 output for all of them
   		
		case 4:
		case 6:
		case 9:
		case 11:
	        printf("Month have 30 days. \n");
	        break;
   
3. In printf you can combine several printfs into one. Example = (The sum of 10 is : %d \n The average is %f)

4. Print odd numbers using only "i" variable direct in loop cycle =  
for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
   {
     printf("%d ",2*i-1);
     sum+=2*i-1;
   }

5. You can define the first part of "For cycle" with the parameter accepting value from another variable. Example:
 for(n=mn;n<=mx;n++)    n=6;
