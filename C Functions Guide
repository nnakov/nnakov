C Language Functions

1. Sorting arrays with ascending order - void qsort(void*base(pointer to first element of the array to be sorted), size_t num(the number of elements in the array pointed by base),
size_t size(the size of each element in the array, int(*comparator)(const void*,const void*)) <- a function that compares two elements

2. Converting two variables without using third one - x = x + y; y = x - y; x = x - y;
3. Diving number with remainder and quotend div_t output = div(nominator,denominator);
4. Finding absolute value - function abs()(only for integers), labs(for long int or long);
5. Finding directory path or other process variables: getenv("for example: PATH"); This function works with char * Pointer or direct by printf();
6. Dynamic Memory Allocation Function:  array(name of array) = (int*) calloc(n(number of variables to be stored(example array limit),sizeof(int));
                         calloc(elements, sizeof(data_type)); elements = number of elements to be stored, sizeof(size of each individual element)
